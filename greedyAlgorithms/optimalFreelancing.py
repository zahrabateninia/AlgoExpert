# Write a function that returns the max profit that can be obtained in a 7-day period
# Each job will take one full day to complete
# Only one job can be worked on at a time

# Sample input:
# jobs = {
#     {"deadline":1, "payment":1},
#     {"deadline":2, "payment":1},
#     {"deadline":2, "payment":2},
# } sample output: 3

# O(n Log(n)) T| O(1) S
